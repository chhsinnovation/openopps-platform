## Task Configuration

### Setting secrets

If you see the following error message:

SailsJS will actively complain about _generated secrets_ when booting up.

```2016-10-17T15:03:43.50-0400 [App/0]      ERR This generated session secret is NOT OK for production!
2016-10-17T15:03:43.50-0400 [App/0]      ERR It will change each time the server starts and break multi-instance deployments.
2016-10-17T15:03:43.50-0400 [App/0]      ERR To set up a session secret, add or update it in `config/session.js`:
2016-10-17T15:03:43.50-0400 [App/0]      ERR module.exports.session = { secret: "keyboardcat" }
```

It means you don't have an environment variable set for the secret.  Please call this variable `SAILS_SECRET`.  It should be a randomly generated long string.


### Task attributes

Part of the test framework is actually used to bootstrap the app when you run `npm run init` it creates tags specified in `test/init/init`. This configuration file defines the standard tags for this installation which control options on the task creation and editing page, as well as icons for skills, topics, agency.

### Full Time Details

Full Time Details are only available to agencies that are specifically enabled in the database.  (For context, inside the state government, Open Opportunities is deployed with a freemium model, where any state employee can post or respond to an opportunity, but if an agency wants to run a program within their agency, they may help fund platform development and access additional features.  One of those features is full-time details).

Full Time Details appear as an option on the Task create and edit pages, implemented in `assets/js/backbone/apps/tasks/new/views/task_form_view.js`.

The code checks the agency that the auth’d user has, and compares with db some fields which whitelist a specific agency for this feature.  There's no UI yet, to set this up.  For GSA specifically, [this script](https://github.com/18F/openopps-platform/blob/dev/tools/postgres/addGSAFullTimeDetail.js) was developed, which adds a `Full Time Detail` tag for `task-time-required` with the agency to enable (in the future, this could be a list of agencies).

```
select type,name,data from tagentity where "name"='Full Time Detail';
```

```
        type        |       name       |                                data
--------------------+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------
 task-time-required | Full Time Detail | {"agency":{"name":"General Services Administration (GSA)","id":20}}
```

## Customizing UI Text

We use an internationalization approach for customizing product text.  Keys and associated translation strings are stored in ```assets/locales/<language>/translation.json```

* Use ‘data-i18n’ tag in HTML elements to set the key used for retrieving internationalized text.
* Call the i18n() function on a JQuery element to recursively translate the element and its sub-elements. Typically done in the render function of a view, after setting the HTML for the element.
* Other messages can be translated by requiring the i18next module and calling the t() function, passing the translation key and optionally default text to use if the key is not found.
* Use $t(‘<key>’) to embed a translation for <key> within another translation string.
* Configuration options are in assets/js/backbone/config/i18n.json and in config/i18next.js. (Only an example server-side configuration, config/i18next.ex.js, is included in the repo.)

See [i18next](http://i18next.com/) for more information on configuration and use.


## Customizing UI

edit ```assets/js/backbone/config/ui.json``` which allows customization of UI features. Currently you can configure the following features:

### Hide Projects

It is possible to turn off the ability to have Projects (which serve as a way to group Opportunities/tasks).  To hide the project UI, simply change "show" to ```false```.

```
{
  "project": {
    "show": true
  }
}
```

### Full Time Details Sample Text

When the Full Time Detail option is enabled (see above), a user may create or edit a task and select "Full Time Detail" in Step 1 (What type of effort is needed?), then the sample text will be added to the task description, if there was no previous description text. There is also an extra link available (Show Default Description) that shows the sample text once it is clicked. The link is not available if the 'Full Time Detail' sample text is not setup.

The value of the description field supports markdown with links and formatting. The description field in the ui.json config file does not support a multiline string; newlines should be escaped as \n.

```
{
  "fullTimeDetail": {
    "description": "Default description **Full Time Detail**.... \n\n_Awesome!_\n\nLinks are also supported: [i18next](http://i18next.com/)."
  }
}
```


## Bulk Import of Tag Data

Bulk import of tags can be done via ```tagTool``` in the tools directory. It can be called like:
```
node tools\tagtool\tagtool.js <tagType> <tagFile>
<tagType>: location, agency, topic, skill, etc
<tagFile>: Filepath/name of file containing newline delimited tags one per line.
```
Database configuration for the tool is pulled from config/local.js. Duplicate tags will not be inserted.

tagTool can also be run from ```grunt```. Running ```grunt initTags``` will run the tool for all files with a .txt extension in tools\tagtool, using the file's name (without extension) as the ```tagType```.


## Configuring Opportunity and Project States

The state of a Project or Opportunity controls it's visibility in certain views and what funcitonality is available. The states currently supported are:

* Open - open for volunteering and discussions, this is the default state
* Assigned - a volunteer has been assigned, discussion is still open
* Archived - closed in a incomplete or unstarted state, no volunteers or discussion
* Completed - closed in a finished state, no volunteers or discussion

These states are listed in ```assets/js/backbone/config/ui.json```.
```
"states" :
    {
     "value": "open",
     "label": "Open"
    },...
```

Changing the value of label is largely cosmetic as it is used to drive drop downs and other display information. If you change the value of value and do not change code to support it midas will behave in an inconsitent manner.

When upgrading Midas from versions prior to .21 you need to run ```./tools/postgres/rename-public-to-open-state.sh``` to update any existing projects or opportunities.

## Adding a one-time modal to the Home page
In ```assets/js/backbone/config/ui.json``` change "modalHome" to true:
```
"modalHome" : {
    "show" : true
  }
```
You also need to add a row to usersetting for **each** user you want to see the modal upon logging in. This row should have the following column values:
```
key = showModalHome
value = true
isActive = true
userId = whichever user(s) you would like to see the modal.
```

The text of the modal is set in the translation file. The default value is **modalHome.text**:
```
"modalHome" : {
    "text" : "<section class='current'><h2>Congratulations!</h2><p>Welcome to the Midas platform.</p></section><section><h2>Congratulations!</h2><p>Welcome to the Midas platform.</p></section><section><h2>Congratulations!</h2><p>Welcome to the Midas platform.</p><p><input type='checkbox' class='tos-checkbox'/> I agree to the <a href=''>Terms and Conditions<a/> required to use this platform.</p></section>"
  }
  ```

## Set up SMTP for Email Notifications

To set up an email provider, add the credentials for your SMTP service to the `/config/local.js` file. For example, using Mandrill:

```js
  emailProtocol: 'SMTP',
  smtp: {
    service             : '',
    host                : 'smtp.mandrillapp.com',
    secureConnection    : false,
    port                : 587,
    auth                : {
      user              : '[mandrill user]',
      pass              : '[mandrill pass]'
    },
    ignoreTLS           : false,
    debug               : false,
    maxConnections      : 5
  },
  systemEmail: '[from address (don't use a GSA address — GSA will block the incoming messages]',
```
